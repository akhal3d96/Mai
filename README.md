# Mai Programming Language

 :construction: *work is still in progress* :construction:

A dynamic, weakly-typed, toy, programming languages.
Designed to be something between Go, Python and JavaScript.

## How to run
So until there is a better building system (as if there's one) the easiest way to test the interpreter is by:
```
# Clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/nemoload/Mai

# Change working directory
$ cd Mai

# Compile it
$ javac com/akhal3d/mai/Mai.java

# Run the examples
$ java com.akhal3d.mai.Mai examples/helloworld.mai
```
See: [examples](https://github.com/nemoload/Mai/tree/master/examples)
